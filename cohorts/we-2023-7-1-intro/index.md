## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Does DPI offer rental laptops for tech prep?
We don't offer laptop rentals right now, but you're welcome to visit DPI at 200 S Wacker weekdays 9-5; we have computers that you can use onsite. If you need additional time, your local library would be the best option. 

### Can I come visit and work from DPI offices?
Yes! We are located at 200 S Wacker, open weekdays 9-5.

If you plan on visiting DPI, please contact an Instructor or TA with the date of your visit so that we can add you to the building's visitor list.  When you arrive, tell a first floor building concierge that you are a DPI visitor, they'll ask for ID and give you a day pass.

### It doesn't let me click on any other assignments besides my last one...
> It doesn't let me click on any other assignments besides my last one, and when i go to the next assignment it tells me "This assignment is currently unavailable because you have not yet completed prerequisites set by your instructor. Please visit your modules page for more information"

You need to do the assignments in order and mark them as done after you complete them to move on to the next assignment

### Are there due dates?
There is only one type of due date, and it is optional: completing work to be eligible for interviews for an upcoming apprenticeship trainee cohort. You are not required to meet this due date, and you may wait for future cohort deadlines.

However, everyone with totals points below 112 (which is about halfway through the course) must remain active in Canvas within any recent 60 days. Otherwise, they will be dropped from the course.  If dropped, someone may request a new enrollment by contacting staff.  Being active means performing any activity such as logging into Canvas, reading pages, completing assignments, or viewing grades.

If you are still stuck (15 minute rule) please book office hours with an instructor or teaching assistant

## Interview Requirements

### ⏰July 12 deadline for Fall cohort
- There are no due dates for this course, but we do have optional deadlines for upcoming cohorts.
- There will be one Fall cohort this year.
- July 12 is the deadline to have completed all curriculum requirements for interviews to the Summer cohort.
- Completing all requirements does not guarantee an interview because more students will complete the requirements than we have time to interview.
- The minimum requirement is the completion all assignments with maximum scores through the end of the Command Line Interface (CLI) Project module.
- Earning more points beyond the minimum requirement can increase the likelihood of being selected for an interview.
- The maximum potential score is achieved by completing all assignments with maximum scores, from the Command Line Interface (CLI) Project module to the end of the course.
- There is no guarantee of being invited for an interview, regardless of the total points earned in this course.

Interviews will be held from July 22 - 26 in person at 200 S Wacker Dr.  An interview will consist of a panel interview and a live coding exam.

Those who are not ready for an interview, are not invited to be interviewed, or do not pass an interview should stay in the course and work toward the next cohort.

### Details (subject to change):
- The minimum requirement is the completion all assignments with maximum scores through the end of the Command Line Interface (CLI) Project module.
- The minimum total points to achieve this goal would be 176
