## Additional Ruby practice
- Overview: Additional Ruby practice
```md
This module contains additional Ruby content ranging from language guides, challenging exercises, and software developer networks.

## Objectives
After completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Possess knowledge from additional Ruby references
- Describe very challenging coding exercises
- Engage in Ruby developer communities

## Activities
- Review Ruby guides and information at Go Rails, Try Ruby, and more.
- Try intermediate-level programming exercises at Exercism
- Engagement with the Ruby developer community at Exercism and Ruby Weekly
```

- Continuous practice with Exercism.org 🏋️‍♂️🔍💻

Let’s exercise our newfound Ruby skills with Exercism.io, a wonderful non-profit project. It’s a community for leveling up programming skills through solving problems, discussion, and mentorship.

Sadly, the demand for Ruby mentorship overwhelmed the supply of mentors, so for the time being you may not receive timely code reviews; but 1) we can still review each other, and 2) the previous solutions and discussions about them are public and still incredibly useful for learning various ways to solve a problem with Ruby.

Furthermore, one of the most valuable things about Exercism is that it has the same problems in different languages. When it comes time to learn new languages (which you certainly will if you continue with software development), a great way to learn new syntaxes is to solve the same problems that you’ve already solved before in a familiar language.

## One-time Setup
1. Sign up for an account at [exercism.org](https://exercism.org).
2. Join the [Ruby Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby).
3. Complete the "Hello World" introductory exercise using the in-browser editor.
4. Once "Hello World" is complete, the "Lasagna" exercise should be unlocked. You can see which exercises are unlocked from the track 
Overview.

5. Complete "Lasagna". There are helpful lessons and hints available in the sidebar.
6. Once you've unlocked it, try the ["Log line Parser" exercise](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/log-line-parser).
7. It may be useful to use experiment in your Ruby Sandbox Codespace, so you can use IRB or print things more easily.
8. Start reading the automated tests and pay attention to how they are written — soon you may want to write tests yourself.
9. Once you've submitted a working solution, the best part for learning: **view Community Solutions**.
  - [Here are some example solutions](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/log-line-parser/solutions/demostudent17). There are two iterations — check out both.
  - Look at a few of the most-starred [Community Solutions](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/log-line-parser/solutions).
  - How do they compare to your solution?
10. Try doing a few Exercism problems each week to keep improving your Ruby skills continuously.

- Try Ruby 💎👩‍💻📚
```md
Have fun playing with this step by step Ruby walkthrough created by the people who maintain the language.

[Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/)
```

- Ruby References 📚🔍💎
```md
Here are links to the official Ruby documentation. Make sure the documentation version matches the version you are running. You can enter `ruby -v` in the terminal to see which version you are running.

- https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/
- https://ruby-doc.org/ 

The documentation is organized by class (eg String, Float, Integer, Hash, etc.), their methods and what they do.

- Subscribe to Ruby Weekly 💎
```md
Subscribe to the [Ruby Weekly email newsletter](https://rubyweekly.com/) (or, as I prefer, subscribe to the RSS feed).

Glance over it each week and see if anything intrigues you; click through if so. Quite often the articles cover beginner/intermediate-level material, and that's what interests me most. I usually skip the advanced stuff.

As a developer, this is:

- how I learn about new libraries that are gaining traction
- how I learn that old libraries received significant updates
- in general, stay on top of trends in the Ruby community
- incidentally, the only way that companies can ever successfully advertise to me, either products or for recruitment

Every language has a similar newsletter; it's worth getting a feel for them.
