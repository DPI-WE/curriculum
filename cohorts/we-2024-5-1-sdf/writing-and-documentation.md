# Writing and Documentation

<!-- TODO: add overview -->

## TIL Blog üìù
```md
Keeping a learning journal is extremely valuable for software developers, for many reasons:

- Writing about what you‚Äôre doing helps clarify and internalize it.
- The post serves as documentation for the code, for teammates and your future self.
- When you inevitably have to do the same task again six months or two years later, you‚Äôve written a cheat sheet for yourself.
- It looks great to prospective employers, demonstrating both writing and technical ability, among other things.

We call these "TIL blogs" or "TILs" ‚Äî short for "Today I Learned". It isn't meant to be a blog where you're publishing brand new ideas that no one has ever thought of before ‚Äî instead, they're just notes to your future self. (But I do learn about a lot of new stuff by reading students' TIL blogs, even after all these years.)

Here is [a learning journal](https://jelani.dev/) from a past student who went on to become an instructor himself, as a great example.

We're going to use [dev.to](https://dev.to/) for our blogs, for now. (In the future you can consider building your own blog ‚Äî that would be a good exercise.)

[Sign up for a dev.to account](https://dev.to/enter) ‚Äî I recommend signing in with GitHub so that you don't have to make up yet another password.

**Submit the URL of your learning journal**. It will look something like `https://dev.to/demostudent18`

Start jotting down notes in your blog. You can save posts as drafts if you're not ready to share them yet.

A great source of TIL blog posts are answers to questions you've asked and other discussions (your own or others). To really cement what you learned, re-write the answer to your question or discussion as a TIL post.

Keep track of everyone's TIL blogs on [news.dpi.dev](https://news.dpi.dev/). Someone else might have already written the answer to your question!

## Taking notes üìù
```md
Please create a `notes` folder inside your `Workspace` folder.

![](./assets/taking-notes-1.png)

I like to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file every morning for all my notes. I usually track how I spend my time, meeting notes, links, and things I need to do that day. I encourage you to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your laptop for writing notes.

If you want to go a step further, make your notes folder a git repository. That way you can push commits to a GitHub repository and share notes between multiple devices.

Please submit a screenshot showing this notes folder with a markdown file for todays notes.
