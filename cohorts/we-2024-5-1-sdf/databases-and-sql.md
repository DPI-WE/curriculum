## (Optional) SQL for Beginners 🧐 📚
```md
GoRails recently released a [SQL for Beginners Series](https://gorails.com/series/sql-for-beginners) of video walkthroughs. Even though we'll mostly be using ActiveRecord as our ORM (object-relational mapping) to translate Ruby code to SQL, knowing some basic SQL will serve you throughout your career. I recommend working through these when you have time.
