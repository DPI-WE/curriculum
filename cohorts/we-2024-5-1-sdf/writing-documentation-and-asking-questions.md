I like to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file every morning for all my notes. I usually track how I spend my time, meeting notes, links, and things I need to do that day. I encourage you to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your laptop for writing notes.

If you want to go a step further, make your notes folder a git repository. That way you can push commits to a GitHub repository and share notes between multiple devices.

Please submit a screenshot showing this notes folder with a markdown file for todays notes.
```

## Rails Guides ü¶Æ <!-- TODO: make this a reading documentation assignment. link to the docs we should reference -->
- **Points**: 0

```md
The [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a terrific resource, and you now have the vocabulary to understand the gist of most of them. Especially these:

For example, I feel like I learn something new every time I read the [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

Peruse through the Rails Guides. You don't have to read them word for word, but get a sense of what's in there so that it rings a bell when you run into a use case. Think of questions to discuss next time (or post them on Ask).
