## Questions ❓
- This course is question-driven.
- We need you to ask questions.
- Speak up whenever you feel like it, raise your hand in the classroom, post a question to Discord or [ask.firstdraft.com](http://ask.firstdraft.com/).
- If you’re not sure whether it’s relevant to everyone, message a TA or Instructor and ask them; they’ll decide and escalate.
- our rule: **You’re only allowed to get stuck for 15 minutes before asking a question.**
- Post your questions on Discord or ask.firstdraft.comLinks to an external site.
- The course is organized according to the the 🔐 lock-before-key principle; until someone asks the question, I won’t provide the info needed to solve an exercise.
- Most of your programming work will be done at your own pace
- Learning occurs through asking questions
- Remember the 15 Minute Rule
- You’re only allowed to get stuck for 15 minutes before you ask a question.
- Don’t spin your wheels for longer than that!
- When you have a question, instead of raising your hand or finding one of us, we want you to first type up your question on [ask.firstdraft.com](http://ask.firstdraft.com/) or Discord.

## Why? 🤨
- Writing out what you’re struggling with will often help you solve it yourself
- Writing well is an essential component of succeeding as a software engineer (remote work, stack overflow, GitHub etc.)

## Asking Questions 🙋
- State the problem you’re working on
- What is your code doing right now?
- What do you want it to be doing instead?
- Copy-paste the snippet(s) of code that you think are relevant.
- Describe what you’ve tried so far to resolve.

## Code Snippets 👨‍💻
Please use [markdown code snippets](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-format-code-in-markdown/) when sharing pieces of code

`<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`

## Answering Questions 🤓
- Keep an eye on [ask.firstdraft.com](http://ask.firstdraft.com/) and try to help your classmates
- After you solve your problem, please update your question with the answer

## Participation 🏆
- "Ask participation" is a component of your overall evaluation/”grade”
- We keep track of:
  1. Number of questions you’ve asked (this is the most important metric)
  2. Number of other peoples’ questions you’ve read (2nd most important metric)
  3. Number of other peoples’ questions you’ve answered

## In Review 📜
- Even though it’s weird to be asking & answering questions on a forum, please give it a try.
- Trust us, it greatly improves learning and retention to write first and then talk it through.

## TIL Blog 📝

Keeping a learning journal is extremely valuable for software developers, for many reasons:

- Writing about what you’re doing helps clarify and internalize it.
- The post serves as documentation for the code, for teammates and your future self.
- When you inevitably have to do the same task again six months or two years later, you’ve written a cheat sheet for yourself.
- It looks great to prospective employers, demonstrating both writing and technical ability, among other things.

We call these "TIL blogs" or "TILs" — short for "Today I Learned". It isn't meant to be a blog where you're publishing brand new ideas that no one has ever thought of before — instead, they're just notes to your future self. (But I do learn about a lot of new stuff by reading students' TIL blogs, even after all these years.)

Here is [a learning journal](https://jelani.dev/) from a past student who went on to become an instructor himself, as a great example.

We're going to use [dev.to](https://dev.to/) for our blogs, for now. (In the future you can consider building your own blog — that would be a good exercise.)

[Sign up for a dev.to account](https://dev.to/enter) — I recommend signing in with GitHub so that you don't have to make up yet another password.

**Submit the URL of your learning journal**. It will look something like `https://dev.to/demostudent18`

Start jotting down notes in your blog. You can save posts as drafts if you're not ready to share them yet.

A great source of TIL blog posts are answers to questions you've asked and other discussions (your own or others). To really cement what you learned, re-write the answer to your question or discussion as a TIL post.

Keep track of everyone's TIL blogs on [news.dpi.dev](https://news.dpi.dev/). Someone else might have already written the answer to your question!

## Taking notes 📝
- **Points**: 2
- **Requirements**: submit the assignment
- **Due**: end of week 1
```md
Please create a `notes` folder inside your `Workspace` folder.

![](./assets/taking-notes-1.png)

I like to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file every morning for all my notes. I usually track how I spend my time, meeting notes, links, and things I need to do that day. I encourage you to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your laptop for writing notes.

![](./assets/taking-notes-2.png)

If you want to go a step further, make your notes folder a git repository. That way you can push commits to a GitHub repository and share notes between multiple devices.

Please submit a screenshot showing this notes folder with a markdown file for todays notes.
```

## Rails Guides 🦮 <!-- TODO: make this a reading documentation assignment. link to the docs we should reference -->

```md
The [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a terrific resource, and you now have the vocabulary to understand the gist of most of them. Especially these:

![](./assets/rails-guides.png)

For example, I feel like I learn something new every time I read the [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

Peruse through the Rails Guides. You don't have to read them word for word, but get a sense of what's in there so that it rings a bell when you run into a use case. Think of questions to discuss next time (or post them on Ask).
