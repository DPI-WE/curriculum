- (Optional) Queries LevelUp Game 👾
```md
Want some fun practice on querying database records with `ActiveRecord`?

Then try out this fun game we built:

https://levelup.firstdraft.com/

See how far you can get through the levels. One note: the game doesn't allow you to `.at(0)` on an `ActiveRecord::Relation`; instead you will need to use the method: `[0]`

`Movie.all[0]`
```

- Association Accessor Wizard 🧙‍♂️🔮
```md
We introduced the association accessor wizard in the previous refactoring project. [See the last six minutes beginning at 23:30 of this walkthrough video](https://share.descript.com/view/wy5mgzsL2WX) for a refresher on that tool, and keep this link handy to help you build your associations:
