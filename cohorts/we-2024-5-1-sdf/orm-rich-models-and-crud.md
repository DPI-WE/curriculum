Want some fun practice on querying database records with `ActiveRecord`?

Then try out this fun game we built:

https://levelup.firstdraft.com/

See how far you can get through the levels. One note: the game doesn't allow you to `.at(0)` on an `ActiveRecord::Relation`; instead you will need to use the method: `[0]`

`Movie.all[0]`
