## Must See Movies with Generators
```md
There is no project associated with this assignment. Just take some time and watch this video, in which I build a Must See Movies application from scratch using generators.

If you want to experiment alongside the project, then go ahead and create new, blank repository [from our Rails 7 template here (give it whatever name you would like!)](https://github.com/new?template_name=rails-7-template&template_owner=appdev-projects).

Generators are extremely important tools when building an app, so watch carefully and write down any questions you have for discussion. The video brings together a lot of what you've learned up to this point!

Please note that the video is from a slightly older version of the project using Ruby version 2.7 and Rails version 6, so there will be some differences to how we've done things so far:

I use `rails db:`, whereas you would now use `rake db:`
I add `.html.erb` to `render` statements in the controller, you would drop these
I may sometimes use optional curly braces on some of the model validation and association accessors, you would drop these
Got it? Alright, now:
