# Generators and User Accounts

**Prerequisites**:
- Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Rich Domain Models, and CRUD

**Requirements**:
- must complete all of these requirements
- must move through requirements in sequential order

## Overview
```md
This module covers the use of Rails generators to streamline the development process, as well as the implementation of user accounts and authentication in your applications. You will learn to create and manage associations, refactor code, and bootstrap applications using generators. Additionally, this module introduces debugging techniques and best practices for ensuring data integrity.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use Rails generators to rapidly scaffold resources and build applications.
- Implement and manage user accounts and authentication.
- Create and manage associations between models.
- Refactor existing codebases for improved readability and maintainability.
- Debug applications to identify and fix issues.
- Ensure data integrity through validations.
```

We introduced the association accessor wizard in the previous refactoring project. [See the last six minutes beginning at 23:30 of this walkthrough video](https://share.descript.com/view/wy5mgzsL2WX) for a refresher on that tool, and keep this link handy to help you build your associations:

## Must See Movies with Generators
- **Points**: 0

```md
There is no project associated with this assignment. Just take some time and watch this video, in which I build a Must See Movies application from scratch using generators.

If you want to experiment alongside the project, then go ahead and create new, blank repository [from our Rails 7 template here (give it whatever name you would like!)](https://github.com/new?template_name=rails-7-template&template_owner=appdev-projects).

Generators are extremely important tools when building an app, so watch carefully and write down any questions you have for discussion. The video brings together a lot of what you've learned up to this point!

Please note that the video is from a slightly older version of the project using Ruby version 2.7 and Rails version 6, so there will be some differences to how we've done things so far:

I use `rails db:`, whereas you would now use `rake db:`
I add `.html.erb` to `render` statements in the controller, you would drop these
I may sometimes use optional curly braces on some of the model validation and association accessors, you would drop these
Got it? Alright, now:

[Sit back, relax, and enjoy the video here](https://share.descript.com/view/vOLIJdopRSz).
