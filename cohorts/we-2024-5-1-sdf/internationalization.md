## i18n 🔤➡️🀄️
```md
i18n (shorthand for internationalization) means providing multi-language support for your application. You can accomplish this by abstracting all the strings (or other region specific bits like date and currency formatting) into a yml file. See the rails guide on i18n for more details.
