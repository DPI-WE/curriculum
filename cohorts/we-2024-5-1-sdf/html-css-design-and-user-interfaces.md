If you find that you're having fun learning about HTML & CSS and would like to learn more about front-end/design, here is a list of optional readings and resources.

I recommend these two readings, at a minimum:

- [Butterick’s Typography In Ten Minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) — the whole book is short and worth a read if you like the 10 minute intro.
- [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html) - and [part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html#rule-4-learn-the-methods-of-overlaying-text-on-images)
```

## Breadcrumbs 🍞

```md
Adding Bootstrap Breadcrumbs is an easy way to indicate the current page’s location within a navigational hierarchy. Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/heratyian/4604ae64c3c4a0e1774d5d4336cc10e3) with a dynamic Ruby on Rails implementation.
```

## Flashes and Alerts 🚨
```md
Implementing [ActionDispatch::Flash](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html) is a great built-in way to notify/alert users of what's happening in your app. [Check out this gist](https://gist.github.com/heratyian/1c556c443fd9c76461fa4b931acf70c3) with flashes styled as dismissible bootstrap alerts.
