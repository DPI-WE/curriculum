### Pull Request for Pundit Policies: add-pundit > add-authorization 📥📋
```md
- Set up policies for the `Photos`, `Users`, `Comments`, and `FollowRequests` controllers.
- We are not requiring a policy for Likes at this point since it's not fully implemented.
- Ask a fellow trainee to review your PR as part of their "giving a code review" assignment.

Check list:
- Have you "secured by default"? E.g. calling `verify_authorized` and `verify_policy_scoped` after each action in the application controller.
- Have you called `authorize` for each action in each controller?
- Have you set up policies for each action in each controller?
- Have you made sure everything is working in the live preview?
- **Please assign Thierry Chau (@thierrychau) to review your pull request**.
