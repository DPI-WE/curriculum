# Final Project

**Prerequisites**:
- JavaScript
- Building Your Own Idea

**Requirements**:
- must complete all of these requirements
- must move through requirements in sequential order

## Overview
```md
The Final Project module is the culmination of all the skills and knowledge you've gained throughout the course. This module guides you through the process of building, refining, and presenting a fully functional web application. You will demonstrate your ability to identify a problem, develop a solution, and present your project to an audience.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will have:

- Developed a fully functional web application.
- Documented your project with a comprehensive functional specification.
- Presented your project effectively to an audience.
- Created a screencast demo video of your project.
- Deployed your project to a live environment and provided a URL for access.
```

## Timeline, Guidelines & Tips for your Presentation üé§
```md
## Timeline
- Week 10: Rehearsals
- Week 10: Final Presentations
- Wednesday Week 12: Final Projects Due
- Thursday, Week 12, 3-7pm: The Showcase! Discovery Room. A science fair style demo where you can network and show off your project with co-workers, friends, and family.
- Friday, Week 12, Turn in equipment

## Guidelines & tips
Here are some guidelines & tips for your presentation:

The goal is present what you've been working on and what you've gained throughout the course.

You should submit a first draft of your slide deck no later than Thursday Week 10, which is when we'll have our rapid-fire rehearsals. "Rapid-fire" means you will present to staff, get feedback, make some updates, present again, get more feedback, make updates ‚Äî rinse and repeat.

You should create slides using Google Slides.
We will combine all of your decks into one to ensure smooth transitions.
Stick with the default aspect ratio (widescreen 16x9).
On your first slide, include your name and anything else that you want to be displayed while you're walking up to the stage.
Share your presentation with us by changing the sharing settings to "Anyone with link", copying the share link, and submitting it in this assignment:

Switch to "Anyone with link":

Aim to keep your presentation ~3-5 minutes.

Practice with each other, and/or in front of a mirror.

A good baseline structure for presenting an app is YOU - PROBLEM - SOLUTION:
1) introduce yourself
2) describe the problem you're trying to solve (a personal anecdote of experiencing the problem is good)
3) jump into the screencast of the solution you built.
Record a screencast rather than doing a live demo ‚Äî you don't want to take any risks with e.g. the internet going down.

If you're on a Mac, you can record your screen with QuickTime.
On other platforms, you can use Screencastify.
Don't bother including the sign-up/sign-in steps in the video; those will be the same for everyone. Be signed in already and jump straight into the unique parts of the app.
Don't show every single user flow. We don't need to see that you can edit and delete all the things ‚Äî that is assumed. Focus in on the most interesting/useful flows, or places that were tricky/you're particularly proud of.

It's always nice when demoing for the app to look attractive. Perhaps it's unfair but it's a fact that people don't give as much credit to the same functionality if it doesn't look good. I'm happy to help with CSS/Bootstrap; come grab me and we can pair program.

## General public speaking tips
In your slides, avoid writing out every word that you plan to say. If there's too much text on a slide, your audience will stop paying attention to what you're saying and instead will read the slide.

Instead, consider short bullet points. I use these all the time (as you know) to help me remember what I mean to say, and in what order. But I keep the prompts pretty short, and I use my words to expand.

Before you start recording a screencast, adjust your browser's zoom level to make things as big as you can without making them look awkward.

If you want to also zoom in on just a portion of the screen, the way I do in class, on Mac you enable it in Accessibility Settings:

![](./assets/final-presentation-guidelines-3.png)

After you check the box for "Use scroll gesture with modifier key to zoom", you should be able to hold Control while scrolling up and down to zoom in and out.

It can sometimes be hard to conclude a presentation. Consider ending with a firm "Thank you" (as opposed to rambling on for longer than you intend and then closing with "okay I guess that's it!"). Add a closing slide that says "Thank you" to remind yourself of this.

If you forget something you wanted to say, or can't think of a word you want to use, don't panic. Just keep going ‚Äî your audience will never know, and won't miss a thing.

Most importantly: remember that it will be a room full of people who are already your fans. Try not to stress (I know it's hard), and try to have fun with it!

- **Requirements**: submit website url
- **Due**: end of week 10
```md
Please submit a link to your google slides. Make sure to give editor permissions for presentation and video to anyone with the link.
```

## Functional Specification üìù
- **Points**: 10
- **Requirements**: submit website url
- **Due**: end of week 12
```md
Please submit the Functional Specification üìù for your final project. This will be used to evaluate if your final project satisfies the requirements.
```

## GitHub Repository URL üîó üì¶
- **Points**: 10
- **Requirements**: submit website url
- **Due**: end of week 12
```md
Make sure to update the repository name and README with details about your project. The README normally documents whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running. If you used a GitHub project for issue tracking make sure to make it public and link to it in the README (or as a comment on this submission).
```

## Screencast Demo Video üé¨
- **Points**: 10
- **Requirements**: submit website url
- **Due**: end of week 12
```md
You will record a very brief (2-5 minute) screencast talking me through your application. What is the name? What problem does it solve? Who is it for? How does it solve this problem? Imagine that in the future some day you will interview for a position as a product manager, and this screencast will be your way of demonstrating that you rolled up your sleeves and learned how to code at one point.

In the screencast, demonstrate the critical, unique flows in your application. You don't have to walk me through signing-up and signing-in as each user; those are not unique flows. It's usually helpful to pre-create some users and other sample data before starting your recording.

You can use any recording method you like. You could record a Zoom call where you are the only participant and sharing your screen. [Screencastify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screencastify-screen-vide/mmeijimgabbpbgpdklnllpncmdofkcpn/related?hl=en) is a free Chrome extension. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is also a great option.

Once recorded, upload the video file to YouTube, Dropbox, Google Drive, or whatever service you prefer; but whatever you choose, you must be able to share a link with us **that does not require signing in**. In other words, **anyone with the link** should be able to view the video. On YouTube, this is known as an Unlisted (not Private) video.
