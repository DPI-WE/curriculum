## Tracking and Managing Exceptions
When your app is live, tracking exceptions is vital. Services like [Airbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake) and [Rollbar](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-gem) can be integrated into your Rails application. These tools help by:

- **Catching Exceptions**: They catch and log errors that occur in real-time.
- **Notification**: You get notified immediately when something goes wrong.
- **Debugging Assistance**: They provide detailed reports and contexts, helping you track down issues quickly.
