# GitHub Workflow

**Prerequisites**:
- Onboarding
- Development Tooling and Practices

**Requirements**:
- must complete all of these requirements

<!-- TODO: overview -->

## Sign up for GitHub 😸
- **Points**: 0
- **Requirements**: mark as done
- **Due**: end of week 1
```md
Please sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and share your profile page. It should be something like this `github.com/<username>`. Please set a profile image and display name using your first and last name so it's easy to tag you. Your GitHub profile is like a software engineering resume. It's important for employers, clients, teammates, etc. to know it's you. I also recommend keeping only 1 GitHub account so your contribution graph is full of green. You can create organizations to separate your repositories.

## Contributing 🙋
- **Points**: 2
- **Requirements**:
- **Due**:
```md
1. "Open Source" simply means you can look at the code yourself and make a contribution.
- You can open any Ruby gem and inspect the source code. The best way to get better at writing code is by reading other people's code. 
- Check out the GitHub repository (eg https://github.com/rails/rails)
- `bundle open <name-of-gem>` (eg `bundle open rails`)
- `gem open <name-of-gem>` (eg `gem open rails`)

All of these open source libraries are listed on https://rubygems.org. If you're feeling bold, you can try creating your own Ruby Gem 💎

- [GoRails - Your First Ruby Gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu2zoy63DeU)
- https://guides.rubygems.org

2. Review issues for known bugs. Browse actual open-source projects on GitHub looking for "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly" tags.
- https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/ruby
- https://goodfirstissues.com
- https://beginnerbounties.com

3. Contributing to an open source project in GitHub usually requires forking, cloning, making changes, and then submitting a pull request to the project. See `contributing` section in README for guidance.

**Optional Assignment**: Make a contribution to open source and share a link/screenshot of your contribution. Share knowledge, submit an issue, ask a question, review a pull request, work on a bounty etc. You may even submit an issue for an assignment or slide deck if you think there is a bug or something is not clear.
```
