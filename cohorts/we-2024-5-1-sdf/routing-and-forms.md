- Rails Guides 🦮
```md
The [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a terrific resource, and you now have the vocabulary to understand the gist of most of them. Especially these:

For example, I feel like I learn something new every time I read the [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

Peruse through the Rails Guides. You don't have to read them word for word, but get a sense of what's in there so that it rings a bell when you run into a use case. Think of questions to discuss next time (or post them on Ask).
