# Domain Modeling

**Prerequisites**:

**Requirements**:
- must complete all of these requirements
- must move through requirements in sequential order

## Overview
```md
This module introduces the essential concepts of domain modeling, which is crucial for designing and organizing the structure of your data within a web application. By creating and analyzing entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), you will learn how to map out the relationships between different data entities, ensuring that your applications are both efficient and scalable.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of domain modeling and its importance in application development.
- Create and interpret entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).
- Identify and define the tables and columns needed to store and manage data.
- Establish relationships between different data entities (one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Apply domain modeling techniques to real-world applications.

Lets examine an [application](https://msm-associations.matchthetarget.com/) that we'll build in class. It's a very simplified version of the iMDB (the Internet Movie Database).
- Click around it for a minute. Observe and identify:
- How are the URLs named? What is indicated by each part of the URL?
- What all information is being stored and displayed on each page?
- If you had to design tables to store all of the information required to power that app, what would they be? What columns would they have? Think of questions.

**Assignment**: Please submit a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the tables/columns needed to store all of the information required to power this app and some sample records.

This lesson practices domain modeling by discussing when to use a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship.

**Assignment**: Can you think of another relationship we could model? Is it a one-to-many or a many-to-many? If One-to-Many, which table gets the foreign key column? If Many-to-Many, what‚Äôs a good name for the join table?

Let's figure out the data model behind [this Todo List app](https://ujs-practice-1.matchthetarget.com/)

- Sign up for an account, click around the app, and acquaint yourself with it.
- You can also sign in with the existing user "alice@example.com", password "password".
- Imagine that it's a mockup, and that you've been hired to build an app like that. (Don't come up with additional features or improvements; our job is to build it as it is now.)
- What tables and columns will you need? Try to produce a complete list of tables and columns.
- I find it helpful to use paper or a spreadsheet to actually draw out all my tables, columns, and try entering in rows to make sure I can record everything necessary for all screens and possible user actions that I can see in the mockup.

## Offer Right ü§ù

Explore this target application: [Offer Right](https://offer-right.matchthetarget.com/).

It's a simplified version of the real [Offer Up](https://offerup.com/) ‚Äî a two-sided market. Users can:

- post items to sell
- browse items to purchase
- chat with sellers to make offers
- sellers can mark items as sold once satisfied
- buyers and sellers coordinate meeting up on their own

Sign up for a new account or use our standard (alice/bob/carol@example.com with password of password). Explore and experiment with the features. I suggest taking notes on the following:

- Identify all of the screens in the app.
- On each screen:
  - What information can you see?
  - What actions can you take? Usually, this means: "what links and buttons can you click?"
  - For each action:
    - What screen do you end up on after you take it?
    - What information was created/read/updated/deleted along the way?

Keeping the notes you took above in mind: design a data model that can support all user actions that you observe in app. I.e., a complete listing of tables and columns.

Remember that it's usually helpful to create your tables on paper or in a spreadsheet and entering some sample records to make sure you can record everything you're trying to record, before attempting to create the compact Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

## Example Solution
There is definitely more than one data model that will work! But here is one example solution. Take a look, compare it to your own, and ask questions if anything is not clear!
