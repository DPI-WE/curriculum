Payments is something most developers should consider adding to their applications. A great way to validate you are solving a real problem is to charge users for the solution. Please explore this example app called [Members Only](https://github.com/appdev-projects/members-only). It is a simple stripe integration that charges users membership dues.

Check out the [pull request diff](https://github.com/appdev-projects/members-only/pull/1/files) to see exactly what we changed from the base rails template.
