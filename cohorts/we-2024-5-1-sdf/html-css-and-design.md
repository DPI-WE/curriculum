If you find that you're having fun learning about HTML & CSS and would like to learn more about front-end/design, here is a list of optional readings and resources.

I recommend these two readings, at a minimum:

- [Butterick’s Typography In Ten Minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) — the whole book is short and worth a read if you like the 10 minute intro.
- [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html) - and [part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html#rule-4-learn-the-methods-of-overlaying-text-on-images)
```
