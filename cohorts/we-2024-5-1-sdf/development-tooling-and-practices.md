We use pre-configured virtual machines (codespaces) to make it really easy to get started developing in Ruby without dealing with environment issues. In a workplace, it's very common to develop locally on your computer.

Checkout this wonderful guide to setting up Ruby and Rails on your own machine. It's good practice for ramping onto a project and getting your machine setup for development.
