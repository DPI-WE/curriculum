# Development Tooling and Practices

## Create a Workspace folder 👷
```md
It's a best practice to keep 1 workspace folder for all of your code. Let's set that up now.

1. Open a terminal on your computer. Enter ⌘+spacebar to open spotlight and type in terminal.

2. Enter `pwd` command to print the working directory. It should look something like this.

`% pwd`

/Users/ianheraty
3. Enter `mkdir Workspace` command to make a `Workspace` directory.


% pwd

/Users/ianheraty

% mkdir Workspace


4. Enter `ls` command to list the contents of your directory and verify you have created the Workspace directory.

% ls             

Applications Downloads Music Workspace

Desktop Library Pictures tmp

Documents Movies Public

5. Enter `open .` command to open the current directory in finder.

`% open .`

6. Drag `Workspace` folder to your favorites for easy access.

## Scratch folder 😼
```md
Please create a `scratch` folder inside your `Workspace`.

This is a place to experiment and create one off scripts and files.

Please submit a screenshot showing this folder.

We use pre-configured virtual machines (codespaces) to make it really easy to get started developing in Ruby without dealing with environment issues. In a workplace, it's very common to develop locally on your computer.

Checkout this wonderful guide to setting up Ruby and Rails on your own machine. It's good practice for ramping onto a project and getting your machine setup for development.
