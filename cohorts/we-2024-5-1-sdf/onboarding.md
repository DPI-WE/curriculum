## Setup your email üìß
- **Requirements**: submit the assignment
<!-- TODO: emphasize setting it up on phone, computer, etc. and to check it frequently -->
<!-- add why we do this -->
```md
Please setup an email client with your account. I use the built in email client on macOS. It is very important to mind your email on the job. When you use an email client it's much easier to monitor incoming emails. (especially if you have multiple accounts)

**Assignment**: Please submit the name of the email client you will be using in class.
```

## Setup your calendar üìÖ
- **Requirements**: submit the assignment
<!-- TODO: emphasize importance to minding your calendar -->
```md
Canvas has a really neat feature: the Calendar.

It will aggregate events, assignments, etc, from all of the courses you are enrolled in:

![](./assets/canvas-calendar-1.png)

It also provides a calendar feed URL, which you can subscribe to in your calendar of choice (I use apple calendar):

![](./assets/canvas-calendar-2.png)

Option A (Outlook):
![](./assets/email-outlook-1.png)

![](./assets/email-outlook-2.png)

Option B (Apple):

![](./assets/ical-1.png)

![](./assets/ical-2.png)

We will be using this feature for scheduling lectures and assignments. Make sure to set the calendar subscription to auto-refresh at least every 15-minutes so you always have an accurate calendar. 

![](./assets/ical-3.png)

Employees are expected to monitor their calendar. This is a good opportunity to practice using your calendar, whether it's Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook or any other.

Please subscribe to the canvas calendar feed and submit the name of your preferred calendar app.

**Assignment**: Enter the name of your calendar application you're using to subscribe to the canvas calendar.
```

## Log in to DPI Dashboard üåê <!-- TODO: move to career development? -->
```md
Please go to https://dashboard.dpi.dev

If this is the first time you are logging in, select the **forgot my password link**, enter your Canvas email, and look for an email verification and sign-in link to set a new password for the dashboard. Check your spam folder for the email if you do not find it in your Inbox.

In the dashboard: update your profile, and **submit your snapshot url**. Make sure to check out your snapshot and edit your profile so it has updated information. We share these snapshots with employers so make sure it is a good reflection of your skills and experience.

Here are some examples from previous cohorts:

## Daily Stand-ups üåü <!-- Discuss more on agile/scrum ceremonies? retro on fridays, etc. -->
<!-- TODO: convert to Learn lesson for scoring -->
- **Requirements**: score at least 2/2
```md
Daily "stand-ups" are a very common practice on "agile" development teams.
A quick meeting ‚Äî 10 minutes or less ‚Äî for the entire team to check in with each other. It's called "stand-up" because it's supposed to be short enough to stand for the entire thing.
You go in a circle and briefly describe three things:
1) what did you work on yesterday?
2) what are you working on today?
3) is anything blocking you?
You may also "pass" if what you did is completely irrelevant to the team (e.g. I took my dog to the vet).
The key part is #3 ‚Äî to find ways to get unblocked. It may be finding people with expertise in what you're struggling with or letting other people know that they're blocking you.
It might feel a little scary to share what you're working on. Maybe you're behind and feel self-conscious? Maybe you're ahead and feel self-conscious?
It's natural and understandable, but we need to overcome this reflex.
We're all on a team together, and on a healthy team, people are transparent with each other. There's no judgment, only support.
Less than 1 minute per person.
What did you work on yesterday?
It's okay to say "I pass" if e.g. you were at a doctor's appt or worked on something not relevant to the team.
What are you planning to work on today?
Try to be specific; not just "Ruby stuff yesterday, more Ruby stuff today". Otherwise you might as well just pass.
Any blockers or "Aha!" moments?
It's okay to say "No blockers". Since we're mostly learning and not yet working on teams, you probably won't have blockers, per se. 
However, instead: try to think of any "Aha!" moments that you had yesterday and share those.
We'll be doing stand-ups every day at 9:15

Remember to spend some time preparing for stand ups by writing down your 3 things.
```
