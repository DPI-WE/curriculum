```md
Daily "stand-ups" are a very common practice on "agile" development teams.
A quick meeting — 10 minutes or less — for the entire team to check in with each other. It's called "stand-up" because it's supposed to be short enough to stand for the entire thing.
You go in a circle and briefly describe three things:
1) what did you work on yesterday?
2) what are you working on today?
3) is anything blocking you?
You may also "pass" if what you did is completely irrelevant to the team (e.g. I took my dog to the vet).
The key part is #3 — to find ways to get unblocked. It may be finding people with expertise in what you're struggling with or letting other people know that they're blocking you.
It might feel a little scary to share what you're working on. Maybe you're behind and feel self-conscious? Maybe you're ahead and feel self-conscious?
It's natural and understandable, but we need to overcome this reflex.
We're all on a team together, and on a healthy team, people are transparent with each other. There's no judgment, only support.
Less than 1 minute per person.
What did you work on yesterday?
It's okay to say "I pass" if e.g. you were at a doctor's appt or worked on something not relevant to the team.
What are you planning to work on today?
Try to be specific; not just "Ruby stuff yesterday, more Ruby stuff today". Otherwise you might as well just pass.
Any blockers or "Aha!" moments?
It's okay to say "No blockers". Since we're mostly learning and not yet working on teams, you probably won't have blockers, per se. 
However, instead: try to think of any "Aha!" moments that you had yesterday and share those.
We'll be doing stand-ups every day at 9:15

Remember to spend some time preparing for stand ups by writing down your 3 things.
