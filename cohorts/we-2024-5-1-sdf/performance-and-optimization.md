Pagination is something most applications should support. Imagine having >1 million records. Does it make sense to render all those records on one page? 🤯 It's a lot more efficient to show the top 10 or 20 records and go from there.

[add pagination with Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) (can also check out [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) and [pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy))
