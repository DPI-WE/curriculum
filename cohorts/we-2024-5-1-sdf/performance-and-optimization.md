# Performance and Optimization

**Prerequisites**:
- JavaScript

**Requirements**:
<!-- none -->

## Overview
```md
This module focuses on techniques and best practices for optimizing the performance of your web applications. You will learn how to implement pagination, searching and filtering, handle N+1 queries, use caching, and manage background jobs. These skills are essential for building scalable and efficient applications.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement pagination to efficiently handle large datasets.
- Add searching and filtering capabilities to your applications.
- Identify and resolve N+1 query issues.

Pagination is something most applications should support. Imagine having >1 million records. Does it make sense to render all those records on one page? 🤯 It's a lot more efficient to show the top 10 or 20 records and go from there.

[add pagination with Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) (can also check out [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) and [pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy))
