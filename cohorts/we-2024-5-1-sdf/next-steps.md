**Impostor syndrome** (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or theimpostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments, and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

> Dude we're all idiots. Don't sweat it. Just be a likeable idiot and a dedicated idiot, and your boss (also an idiot) will value your contributions. And if he doesn't... He's an idiot anyway, so who cares?

1. **Recognize and Label the Feelings**: Understand that Impostor Syndrome is a common phenomenon. Just recognizing that what you're feeling has a name and is experienced by many can be a relief.
2. **Separate Feelings from Facts**: Just because you feel inadequate doesn't mean you are. Always cross-check your feelings with the facts. For instance, if you‚Äôve been successful at tasks in the past, there's a good chance you're competent now.
3. **Talk About It**: Share your feelings with a trusted friend, mentor, or colleague. More often than not, they have felt the same way at some point and can offer advice or reassurance.
4. **Document Your Achievements**: Keep a record of things you‚Äôve accomplished, positive feedback you've received, or challenges you've overcome. Review this when you‚Äôre feeling inadequate.
5. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Understand that nobody, regardless of how experienced, knows everything. It's okay to ask questions and make mistakes. This is how learning happens.
6. **Seek Mentorship**: Surrounding yourself with supportive mentors can help you navigate through challenging times. They can provide you with guidance and share their own experiences with Impostor Syndrome.
7. **Continuous Learning**: Tech is an ever-evolving field. Set aside time to learn and grow. When you invest in your skills and knowledge, you build confidence.
8. **Reframe Failure**: Instead of seeing mistakes or failures as proof of your inadequacy, see them as growth opportunities. They‚Äôre a natural part of learning and innovation.
9. **Stop Comparing**: Everyone's journey is unique. While it's natural to compare yourself to others, it can amplify feelings of impostor syndrome. Focus on your own progress and growth.
10. **Practice Self-compassion**: Remember, everyone has moments of doubt. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a dear friend in the same situation.
11. **Visualize Success**: Take a moment to visualize your success and achievements. By regularly focusing on positive outcomes, you can shift your mindset over time.
12. **Visualize Failure**: What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?

Lastly, remember that Impostor Syndrome can strike anyone, irrespective of their level of expertise. Many successful individuals in tech, from junior developers to industry-leading experts, have experienced these feelings. Over time, with the right strategies and support, you can manage and even overcome these feelings of self-doubt.

Everyone just googles, chat GPTs and makes their best educated guess. Focus on Taking notes üìù, Asking Questions üôã, and understanding that [Acronyms Seriously Suck ü•≤](https://gist.github.com/klaaspieter/12cd68f54bb71a3940eae5cdd4ea1764).

For all of the resources below: keep writing your Today I Learned blog posts. It's incredibly useful to cement your learning, and also employers love seeing it.

1. **Build stuff**: Reading books and doing courses is useful, but not as useful as working on real projects.

It could be your own ideas, it could be friends' ideas, small freelance projects that you find through your network or [Upwork](https://upwork.com/), [Beginner Bounties](https://beginnerbounties.com/), etc.

It can be intimidating to start taking on freelance projects, but the instructors are here to guide you (which is amazing, I would have killed for that). **Keep posting questions on Discord**.

2. **CSS**: No matter where you end up in tech, you can't go wrong with learning more CSS. Even if you're gravitating towards back end, project management, user experience, etc, being better at CSS will make you better at whatever you're doing.

Last year, an amazing resource came out ‚Äî [Josh Comeau's CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/).

It's expensive ($399), but happily, DPI has negotiated a discount and purchased multiple licenses. Send a message to Morgan when you're ready to go through it, and include your personal email address (not your student worker address) in the message, and we'll send you an invitation to the course.

It's called *CSS for JavaScript Developers*, but it's really for everyone, not just JavaScript developers. You can skip the chapters that deal with integrating CSS into JavaScript.

3. **Command line, etc**: A great course for everyone is [MIT's The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It will fill in some gaps re: the command line, Git, etc.

4. **CS50**: Now that you have some context, it's time to learn some computer science fundamentals. Harvard's CS50 is an excellent resource for that. It's free, but you can pay if you want a certificate.

Start with [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0).

After that, explore [the spinoffs of CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/catalog?keywords=cs50&op=Search) ‚Äî [web dev with Python and JS](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=1), [artificial intelligence](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python?delta=1), or even [cs124](https://www.cs124.org/) a java/kotlin course from uillinois.

<!-- TODO: update join link -->
5. **Data science**: If you're interested in exploring Data Science, [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a great resource. To join the team, this link will work if you have a `@gmail.com` or `@uillinois.edu` email address.

DataCamp has tracks to guide your learning depending on your interests ‚Äî Python, R, SQL, Tableau, etc.

We also have access to a fantastic data science course developed by the University of Illinois, [Data Science Discovery](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/)

6. **Front-end development**: Nowadays, "front-end" basically translates to "JavaScript" and often a single page application (SPA) framework like "React".

First, you should learn more JavaScript. I recommend [this free introduction to JavaScript from Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). After that, [they have a good deeper dive](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascript), but it requires a subscription.

Then, we've purchased another amazing resource for you ‚Äî [Josh Comeau's The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/). Send a message to Morgan when you're ready to go through it, and include your personal email address (not your student worker address) in the message, and we'll send you an invitation to the course.

Once you've learned React for the web, you can progress to React Native for building native iOS/Android apps. So learning React has a high return-on-investment. (you could also try making your Rails app mobile native using [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native))

7. **SQL**: No matter what language/framework you are using, it's always helpful to be proficient in SQL so that you can interact with your database directly, for those occasions when ActiveRecord can't solve your problem for you.

We've purchased a great resource for you ‚Äî [Dimitri Fontaine's The Art of PostgreSQL](https://theartofpostgresql.com/). Send a message to Morgan when you're ready to go through it.

8. **Rails**: To level up and cement your Rails knowledge:

-  [Chris Oliver's Go Rails](https://gorails.com/path). As of this writing, you can get a year free through [GitHub's Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
- [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
- A bunch of other task-specific resources (e.g. writing your own automated tests) that we can recommend when you run into the need for it. Ask us.

9. **Python**: There's an (accurate) joke that Python isn't the best language for anything, but it's the second best language for everything. You should be conversant in Python.

[This Python course from the University of Michigan](https://online.umich.edu/series/python-for-everybody/) is very good.

10. **Infrastructure / DevOps / Systems administration / Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Pick a functional app (it could be your project or Photogram) and try deploying it to:

- Heroku
- Render
- Fly.io
- Azure App Service
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Digital Ocean
- Google Cloud Platform

This will give you a well-rounded idea of what is involved with deployment.

Then, learn Docker. I like the book [Docker for Rails Developers](https://pragprog.com/titles/ridocker/docker-for-rails-developers/) for that.

Then, re-deploy your app to the clouds listed above using Docker.

11. **Cloud Certifications**:
Get a developer certification for one of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). Practice tests help!

12. **Other languages besides Ruby and other frameworks besides Rails**: Ruby is a great first language, and Rails is a great first framework ‚Äî but you can't stop there. Good developers are polyglots, so that they can choose the right language/framework for the job at hand.

Now that you have a good sense of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, and Javascript, it's a great time to explore new technology stacks. There are limitless ways to build a web application, and, as a software engineer, you have signed up to be a lifelong learner. In that spirit, we encourage you to rewrite a rails assignment (eg Photogram or a demo from class) in a technology stack of your choosing.

Some great options include:

- [Spring (Java)](https://spring.io/)
- [Django (Python)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Flask (Python)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [.NET Core MVC (C#)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Next.js (Javascript)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MEAN / MERN / MEVN (Javascript)](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mean-stack-tutorial)
- [Laravel (PHP)](https://laravel.com/)
- Mobile (iOS, Android, Cross-Platform)

Add a test-suite to a rails assignment (for folks interested in QA) or any stack you are interested in.

You can do this assignment as many times as you like. Not only will this reinforce your learning, but will help us identify you when roles in these stacks pop up.

**Optional Assignment**:  Rewrite an assignment from the course (eg Photogram or a demo from class) in a technology stack of your choosing. Submit a GitHub repository link and a deployed app url.
