  Lets examine an [application](https://msm-associations.matchthetarget.com/) that we'll build in class. It's a very simplified version of the iMDB (the Internet Movie Database).
    - Click around it for a minute. Observe and identify:
    - How are the URLs named? What is indicated by each part of the URL?
    - What all information is being stored and displayed on each page?
    - If you had to design tables to store all of the information required to power that app, what would they be? What columns would they have? Think of questions.

  **Assignment**: Please submit a list of the tables/columns needed to store all of the information required to power this app.

This lesson practices domain modeling by discussing when to use a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship.

**Assignment**: Can you think of another relationship we could model? Is it a one-to-many or a many-to-many? If One-to-Many, which table gets the foreign key column? If Many-to-Many, what’s a good name for the join table?
