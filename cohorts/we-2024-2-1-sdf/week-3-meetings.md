Let's figure out the data model behind [an app called Very Best](https://verybest.matchthetarget.com/).

Sign in with one of the existing users (All of their passwords are "password"):
  - alice@example.com
  - bob@example.com
  - carol@example.com
  - doug@example.com
  - ellen@example.com

Imagine that it's a mockup, and that you've been hired to build an app like that. (Don't come up with additional features or improvements; our job is to build it as it is now.)
What tables and columns will you need? Try to produce a complete list of tables and columns.
I find it helpful to use paper or a spreadsheet to actually draw out all my tables, columns, and try entering in rows to make sure I can record everything necessary for all screens and possible user actions that I can see in the mockup.

**Assignment**: Please submit a screenshot of the entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the first draft Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool

  - You can also sign in with the existing user "alice@example.com", password "password".
