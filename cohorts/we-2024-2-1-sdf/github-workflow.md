- Contributing 🙋
  ```md
  1. "Open Source" simply means you can look at the code yourself and make a contribution.
    - You can open any Ruby gem and inspect the source code. The best way to get better at writing code is by reading other people's code. 
    - Check out the GitHub repository (eg https://github.com/rails/rails)
    - `bundle open <name-of-gem>` (eg `bundle open rails`)
    - `gem open <name-of-gem>` (eg `gem open rails`)

  All of these open source libraries are listed on https://rubygems.org. If you're feeling bold, you can try creating your own Ruby Gem 💎

  2. Review issues for known bugs. Browse actual open-source projects on GitHub looking for "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly" tags.

  3. Contributing to an open source project in GitHub usually requires forking, cloning, making changes, and then submitting a pull request to the project. See `contributing` section in README for guidance.

  **Optional Assignment**: Make a contribution to open source and share a link/screenshot of your contribution. Share knowledge, submit an issue, ask a question, review a pull request, work on a bounty etc. You may even submit an issue for an assignment or slide deck if you think there is a bug or something is not clear.
