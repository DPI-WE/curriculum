- Payments 🤑
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/iTR6_eIlHzA)
  ```md
  Payments is something most developers should consider adding to their applications. A great way to validate you are solving a real problem is to charge users for the solution. Please explore this example app called [Members Only](https://github.com/appdev-projects/members-only). It is a simple stripe integration that charges users membership dues.

  Check out the [pull request diff](https://github.com/appdev-projects/members-only/pull/1/files) to see exactly what we changed from the base rails template.

- Setting Up a Development Environment 🧑‍💻
  - [Learn](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/332-setting-up-a-development-environment)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/DPI-WE/setting-up-a-development-environment)
  ```md
  We use pre-configured virtual machines (codespaces) to make it really easy to get started developing in Ruby without dealing with environment issues. In a workplace, it's very common to develop locally on your computer.

  Checkout this wonderful guide to setting up Ruby and Rails on your own machine. It's good practice for ramping onto a project and getting your machine setup for development.

  Adding Bootstrap Breadcrumbs is an easy way to indicate the current page’s location within a navigational hierarchy. Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/heratyian/4604ae64c3c4a0e1774d5d4336cc10e3) with a dynamic Ruby on Rails implementation.

- Flashes / Alerts 🚨
  ```md
  Implementing [ActionDispatch::Flash](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html) is a great built-in way to notify/alert users of what's happening in your app. [Check out this gist](https://gist.github.com/heratyian/1c556c443fd9c76461fa4b931acf70c3) with flashes styled as dismissible bootstrap alerts.

- Pagination 📄
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/zxtc5Ye-TkY)
  - [Pull Request](https://github.com/DPI-WE/readit/pull/13)
  ```md
  Pagination is something most applications should support. Imagine having >1 million records. Does it make sense to render all those records on one page? 🤯 It's a lot more efficient to show the top 10 or 20 records and go from there.

  [add pagination with Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) (can also check out [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) and [pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy))
