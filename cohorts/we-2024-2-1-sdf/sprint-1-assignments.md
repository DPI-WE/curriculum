- Rails Guides 🦮
```md
The [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are a terrific resource, and you now have the vocabulary to understand the gist of most of them. Especially these:

For example, I feel like I learn something new every time I read the [Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

[ActiveRecord Callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html) is a core feature of ActiveRecord that we end up using in nearly every application for e.g. massaging a user input (say downcasing it) before validating it/saving it.

Peruse through the Rails Guides. You don't have to read them word for word, but get a sense of what's in there so that it rings a bell when you run into a use case. Think of questions to discuss next time (or post them on Ask).

SQL (optional)
Active Record does SQL well & on our behalf, basic SQL is easy enough, this is informational at this point:

- (Optional) SQL for Beginners 🧐 📚
```md
GoRails recently released a [SQL for Beginners Series](https://gorails.com/series/sql-for-beginners) of video walkthroughs. Even though we'll mostly be using ActiveRecord as our ORM (object-relational mapping) to translate Ruby code to SQL, knowing some basic SQL will serve you throughout your career. I recommend working through these when you have time.
