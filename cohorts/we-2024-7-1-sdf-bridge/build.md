<!-- TODO -->
<!-- 1. **Build stuff**: Reading books and doing courses is useful, but not as useful as working on real projects.

It could be your own ideas, it could be friends' ideas, small freelance projects that you find through your network or [Upwork](https://upwork.com/), [Beginner Bounties](https://beginnerbounties.com/), etc.

It can be intimidating to start taking on freelance projects, but the instructors are here to guide you (which is amazing, I would have killed for that). **Keep posting questions on Discord**. -->
