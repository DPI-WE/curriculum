<!-- 10. **Infrastructure / DevOps / Systems administration / Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Pick a functional app (it could be your project or Photogram) and try deploying it to:

- Heroku
- Render
- Fly.io
- Azure App Service
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Digital Ocean
- Google Cloud Platform

This will give you a well-rounded idea of what is involved with deployment.

Then, learn Docker. I like the book [Docker for Rails Developers](https://pragprog.com/titles/ridocker/docker-for-rails-developers/) for that.

Then, re-deploy your app to the clouds listed above using Docker.

11. **Cloud Certifications**:
Get a developer certification for one of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). Practice tests help! -->
