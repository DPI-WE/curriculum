<!-- 3. **Command line, etc**: A great course for everyone is [MIT's The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It will fill in some gaps re: the command line, Git, etc.

4. **CS50**: Now that you have some context, it's time to learn some computer science fundamentals. Harvard's CS50 is an excellent resource for that. It's free, but you can pay if you want a certificate.

Start with [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0).

After that, explore [the spinoffs of CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/catalog?keywords=cs50&op=Search) — [web dev with Python and JS](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=1), [artificial intelligence](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python?delta=1), or even [cs124](https://www.cs124.org/) a java/kotlin course from uillinois. -->
