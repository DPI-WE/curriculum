Sometimes when coding, you can get stuck or face a problem that you can't figure out. A technique many programmers use is to talk through the problem as if they're explaining it to someone else. This process can help clarify the issue and lead to a solution.

This technique is affectionately called **"rubber ducking"**. The name originates from a story where a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by explaining it, line-by-line, to the duck.

The key concept here is that by vocalizing the problem and attempting to explain it in simpler terms, you often see the problem from a new angle or realize an aspect you hadn't previously considered.

Instead of using your instructors or classmates as your sounding board (which might take up their time, especially if they are also busy with their own work), try using an inanimate object or a pet as your audience. This could be your dog, cat, or even an actual rubber duck.

The idea isn't that these listeners will provide solutions, but that the act of explaining itself can help you see the solution. This also builds independence and self-reliance in problem-solving.
