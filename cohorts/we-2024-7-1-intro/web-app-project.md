# Web App Project
- Web App Project ⭐
```md
## About this assignment
You've acquired all the skills you need to build and deploy your own dynamic web applications. Jot down what you're thinking here, so that we can start to scope/filter the ideas and select a good one to start with. We're just looking for good, small learning projects. Just get any and all ideas out of your head and down on "paper".

## Template
Create a fork from the [appdev-projects/sinatra-template](https://github.com/appdev-projects/sinatra-template) repository to setup a base coding environment to start. Create a meaningful and relevant name for your repo. Include a README.

## Specs
- Create a repository with a meaningful name
- Create a README that includes details on what the app does and how to use it
- Make at least one 3rd party API call
- Have some excellent CSS styling for presenting the response from your API call(s). Refer to the [LinkIn Bio assignment](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/109) for guidance.
- Don't use a database even though the template mentions it

## Web APIs
We've already experimented with a few APIs in the [HTTP & APIs module](https://dpi.instructure.com/courses/185/modules/499?wrap=1). Here are some more free APIs you can use in your project.

- [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
