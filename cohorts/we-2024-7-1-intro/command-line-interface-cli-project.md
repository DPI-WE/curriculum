### Template
Create a new repository from [this template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=ruby-cli-template&template_owner=DPI-WE) to setup a base coding environment to start. Create a meaningful and relevant name for your repo.

### Specs
Your project must demonstrate the following criteria:

- Your own Ruby class (with an initialize method)
- Attributes for an instance variable (eg use @ with attr_accessor, attr_writer, attr_reader, and/or your own custom getters/setters)
- Accept user input from the terminal
  - [gets](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#gets)
  - [chomp](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference#chomp)
- A meaningful repo name with a README that includes details on what your CLI app does and how to use it
- ⏰ Include 1 or 2 tests as described in the new lesson [Testing your code with MiniTest 🧪](testing.md#testing-your-code-with-minitest-).  Be sure to put your test(s) in a folder named 'tests'.

### What to submit
Submit a GitHub URL. Make sure your GitHub repository has a name reflective of what the code does.
