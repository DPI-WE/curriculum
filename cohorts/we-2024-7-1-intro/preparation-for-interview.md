## Technical Preparation

Preparing for the technical aspects of a software development interview requires a solid understanding of fundamental concepts in Ruby and the ability to apply them in practical scenarios. Here are key steps to help you prepare:

### 1. Master Ruby Basics
- **Core Concepts**: Ensure you have a strong grasp of basic Ruby syntax, object-oriented programming principles, and common libraries.
- **Practice Exercises**: Use platforms like [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/ruby) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) to practice coding problems in ruby.

### 2. Debugging and Testing
- Hone your debugging skills by working through bugs in your own code and understanding common error messages.
- Practice writing tests for your code using tools like RSpec and MiniTest.

### 3. Ruby Resources
- Explore the [Ruby Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) and tutorials on [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/).
- Engage with the Ruby community through forums and GitHub projects.

## Panel Interview Preparation

Preparing for a panel interview involves understanding the dynamics of interacting with multiple interviewers and presenting yourself effectively. Here are steps to help you prepare:

### 1. Research the Company and Panelists
