## Overview: Career Exploration 🚀🔎
Part of the objective of Tech Prep is to give you a feel for what a software developer does and how you can translate a solid, foundational programming  course into a variety of career pathways. The field has many exciting benefits--challenging work, well-paying jobs, higher likelihood of remote or flexible schedules--that attract people. However, because of the rigor of the apprenticeship, we want you to continue on this path with a well-rounded view of what it means to be a developer: the good and the bad. We are not here to discourage you; we believe that you can do this and know that the world needs your perspective to change and improve tech.

Use this module to explore and confirm what excites you about this opportunity. And before learning more about the field, we've included some optional videos about computers and the internet to help demystify tech.
