If this is your first time programming, then it's a lot of new concepts to absorb! Sometimes hearing the same concepts in different words helps.

To get a different perspective on Ruby fundamentals, you should go through [Codecademy's Learn Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby).

Required: Parts 1—6 (Introduction to Ruby ~ Hashes and Symbols) cover essential concepts that we'll be using often.

Optional stretch goal: Parts 7—10 (Refactoring ~ Object-Orientated Programming, Part II) cover concepts that aren't essential right now, but are a good warm-up for the future.
